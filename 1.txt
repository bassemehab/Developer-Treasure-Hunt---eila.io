This task is made to evaluate your problem solving skills. Feel free to write the
solution in any language of your own choice but make sure that your solution will produce
the right results on https://ideone.com/ or a similar online platform.

We will judge your solution by:
- Readability and comments
- Modularity and usability
- and for sure the code has to work.

Question 1:
"Write a function that takes two sorted arrays and merge them efficiently in one
array? In the comments explain what is the complexity of your solution? 

arrays: [88b, 20v, 11i, 83m, 29r, 82i, 40m, 8h], [51e, 5s, 22e, 64t, 90e, 91r, 99s]

Once you've arranged them, type the sentence that you get, to me, here in Messenger. (hint: just the sentence, forget the numbers) & please keep the code for that, you'll need to send it over later. "

Examples: 
- ['aa', 'xx', 'zz'], ['bb', 'cc'] returns ['aa', 'bb', 'cc', 'xx', 'zz']
- [1, 5, 6, 11, 23], [3, 9, 15, 19] return [1, 3, 5, 6, 9, 11, 19, 23]
