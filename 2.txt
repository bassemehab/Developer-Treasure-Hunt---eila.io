Question 2: Write a function that returns the top 5 most common strings in a the below paragraph starting with the most common to least common. In the comments write the reason why you chose the data structure, the complexity of your solution? (Note: Ignore capital letters) & please keep the code for that, you'll need to send it over later. 

“Yo ho, yo ho, a pirate's life for me
We pillage, we plunder, we rifle, and loot
Drink up, me 'earties, yo ho
We kidnap and ravage and don't give a hoot
Drink up me 'earties, yo ho

Yo ho, yo ho, a pirate's life for me
We extort, we pilfer, we filch, and sack
Drink up, me 'earties, yo ho
Maraud and embezzle, and even high-jack
Drink up, me 'earties, yo ho

Yo ho, yo ho, a pirate's life for me
We kindle and char, inflame and ignite
Drink up, me 'earties, yo ho
We burn up the city, we're really a fright
Drink up, me 'earties, yo ho

We're rascals, scoundrels, villans, and knaves
Drink up, me 'earties, yo ho
We're devils and black sheep, really bad eggs
Drink up, me 'earties, yo ho”

Example:
Input: 
We are not what we should be
We are not what we need to be
But at least we are not what we used to be
are not we?

Output:
we 7
are 4
not 4
what 3
be 3

Once you're done, type in the number you get from top to bottom (ONLY FOR THE TOP 5 WORDS), to me in Messenger. (In the example, the number would be: 84433).
